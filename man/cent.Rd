\title{Detect regions of interest (regions of m/z vs rt space with high densitites of peaks)}
\usage{
cent(mz, i, scanindex, ppm = 2, prefilter = c(0, 0), maxskip = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{mz}{numeric A vector of exact mass centroids, all scans concatenated.}

\item{i}{numeric A vector of intensities corresponding to \code{mz}, all scans concatenated.}

\item{scanindex}{integer A vector of integers corresponding to the start of a new scan in the \code{mz} and \code{i} vectors.}

\item{ppm}{numeric the ppm mass error acceptable before a new ROI is initialized. This ppm is allowed on both sides of the mass.}

\item{prefilter}{numeric a two integer vector.  The first indicates the minimum number of peaks an ROI must contain to be retained.  The second indicates the minimum intensity those muct be.}

\item{maxskip}{integer The number of scans an ROI must not contain a peak before clossing the ROI.  \emph{This is an addition to the original algorithm. Useful for QE data.}}
}
\value{
A list, one entry for each region of interest.
}
\description{
\code{cent} returns a list of all regions of interest as rectangles in m/z vs rt space.
}
\details{
This function is a C++ implementation of the region of interest detection algorithm described in the centWave paper. The algorithm steps through scans sequentially and performs the following steps for every peak:
\enumerate{
 \item If there exists an ROI encompassing the mass, add the peak to that ROI.
 \item If an appropriate ROI does not exist, create a new ROI.
 \item Check all unfinished ROIs - if a peak hasn't been added within the previous \code{maxskip} scans save it.
