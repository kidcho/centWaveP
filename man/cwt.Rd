\title{Apply the continuous wavelet transform to a signal}
\usage{
cwt(obs, scales, psi = "mexh")
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{vector of the time dependent signal.  In our case, intensities.}

\item{scales}{vector of the wavelet scales which to apply.}

\item{psi}{the wavelet to apply. "mexh", "nmexh" or a data.frame containing the wavelet.}
}
\value{
A matrix, rows corresponding to wavelet scales, columns to time.
}
\description{
\code{cwt} returns a matrix of wavelet coefficients for the specified scales.
}
\details{
This function is a modification of the original cwt code provided by the centWave algorithm [1], [2] and [3].
